# Monsoon-Network
This project includes a Hyperledge-Fabric based blockchain Network and a native Adnroid app to interact with that network.  The network connects donors to the farmers in the Indian Subcontinent who are affected by the Monsoon disaster. 

# High Level Overview
## Combating Monsoon Disaster with Technology and Compassion

### The Problem:
Monsoon affects many parts of the world along the equator but, due to its geography, the phenomenon is particularly devastating for the Indian Subcontinent that includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

Every year, two Monsoon seasons result in severe damages to the crops and loss of life in various parts of the region. One billion people who earn their living through farming related activities are usually the poorest demographics of the society. 

### The Dilemma:
People who are in a position to help rarely get to hear about the devastated communities as they may be located in remote areas that usually do not have proper communication and transportation infrastructures. Affluent donors from foreign countries and urban areas are also reluctant to donate because they do not trust the local charitable organizations and have no means to verify if their donation are actually reaching the Monsoon ravaged population. 

### The Solution:
Our platform called the “Monsoon Network” uses the power of mobile apps, geolocation, blockchain and AI technologies in order to bring trust and transparency to the Monsoon recovery and rehabilitation efforts. The network connects donors and the farmers at a micro level in advance to prepare for the potential monsoon strike. The Monsoon Network has the following 4 participants:

### Donors: 
Individual or institutional donors make pledges to support farmer for the registered crops. Donors are in full-control of their donations by committing funds based on their personal criteria.

### Farmers: 
Farmers register their crop assets on the network and provide all the necessary data. They get the pledged funds in the event of crop loss.
Monitors: These are individuals or organization to ensure compliance and trust in the network.

### Developers: 
Developers carry out the following activities: 
- Develop smart contracts to address the needs of the farmers and the donors based on the regional needs.
- Promote the network to the farmers and train/support them for crop registrations.
- Be the ears and eyes of the donors to ensure trust and transparency.
- Create data analysis views and AI-based apps for other network participants to detect fraudulent activities.
